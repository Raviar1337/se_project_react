# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

The user can also add their own clothhing to the list and specify the weather conditions each clothing item
is suitable for and have a custom list filtered from their own clothing
